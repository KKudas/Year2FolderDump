# Third Activity Geometry
<u><b>Project: Geometry</u></b> <br/>
<u><b>Package: version1</u></b>

<b>MyPoint</b>
- Defined by two coordinates
- overload constructors
- have setters & getters
- <b>getDistance()</b>
  1. Accept a new point as coordinated and measure the distance from that point to the current point instance.
  2. Acceps a new point as MyPoint and measure the distance from that point to the current point instance
  3. Measure the distance from the current point to origin.
- <b>void displayPoint()</b>
  1. if x=5, y=10 display in format (5,10)
- override the method toString() to have a string representation like the display point
- <b>getQuadrant()</b>
  1. returns the quadrang 1-4
  2. returns 0 if in origin
  3. returns 5 if in x-axis
  4. returns 6 if in y-axis
- <b>getAngle()</b>
  1. returns the angle formed from the positive x-axis
